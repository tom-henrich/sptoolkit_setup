### Set Allowed Users
# There are 2 ways of doing this, see JupyterHub tutorial    
# https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authentication.html
# WAY 1: Manually add  allowed users : (this is WAY easier)
#auth:
#  whitelist:
#  users:
#    - user1
#    - user2
#
# WAY 2: Add users using gmail accounts, or Oauth : (this is HARD)
# 1: U need a website name, see google domains:
# https://domains.google/
# 2: U need to registe website with googel webmaster
# https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/
# 3: U need to Set google cloud DNS records
# https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en
# 4: This is great video on DNS records
