# How to Finish Setting Up Jupyter

**PLEASE NOTE:** This file isn't done yet. (Taking a break after video) But if it's still not done by Christmas 2018, then yell at me in the youtube comments or on github and I'll get back to it! Also If you know how to get the usernames working let me know! :)

This readme explains how to finish setting up JupyterHub from my youtube tutorial. There are **2** important things that still need to be done:
1. Only allow specific users
2. Make JupyterHub work for *https*

Previously I have accomplished the first task so I will explain how to setup the usernames and sometime soone I will update the files in the repo. As for step 2, if someone else knows how this is done, please let me know!

# Setting Users:

**Basic Idea:** (will add this soon)
